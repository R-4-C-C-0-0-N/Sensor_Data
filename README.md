# Overview
Sensor Data is a simple android application that records 2 categories (motion & positional) of mobile sensor data in real time. Users must grant permission for sensor initialization and internal storage access before they can use the application. Sensor recordings are divided into sessions, and actions are recorded in logs with system timestamps. Logs are accessible via the application's internal storage directory. Sensor recordings can be monitored in real time, and users can save them in .csv format, which is alsoÂ  accessible from the application's internal storage directory.
